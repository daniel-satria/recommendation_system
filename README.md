# Recomendation System

1. Intro & Recommendation System Workflow
2. Measure Similarity & Content-based Recommendation System
3. Evaluation of Recommendation System
4. Collaborative Filtering
5. Matrix Factorization : SVD & Funk SVD
6. [Collaborative Filtering with Context & Factorization Machine](notebooks/6-context_aware_factorization_machine.ipynb)
7. Recommendation System for Implicit Data & Logistic Matrix Factorization
8. Learning to Rank & Bayesian Personalized Ranking

This repository objective is to record all the algorithm and technique I use to build a recommender system.

So far, I only upload two algo, which are :
1. SVD
2. Funk SVD
3. Factorization Machine


I will update the repo with more algo depends on time.
